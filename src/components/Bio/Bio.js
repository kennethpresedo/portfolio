            I'm Kenneth Presedo, #LatinoInTech, 33, from Miami, Fl. Son of Argentinian parents and father to 2 dogs and 2 cats. I love traveling, music, sports, animals, and coding every opportunity I get. I'm a motivated Jr. Full Stack Software Engineer looking for my first break into Web Development.
